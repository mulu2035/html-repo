Understanding HTML
****************** 

	What is HTML? - Hyper-Text Markup Language  
	****************************************** 

		It is just a standardized system of tagging a text file 

		- A text file that is "tagged" following the "HTML standard" is called an: 
			- HTML document 

		- Both web developers and web browsers follow this standard to generate expected outcomes

	HTML Versions (The Standard) 
	**************************** 
		
		- Five versions so far 
			- (HTML 1.0 - HTML5)

		- DOCTYPE 
			- Is not an HTML tag 
			- It is just an instruction for your browser to tell what version of HTML your document is using 

			- DOCTYPE declarations 
			https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp
				- Ex: 
					- HTML 5: (Only use this one) 
						<!DOCTYPE html>

					- HTML 4: 
						<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">


		- Focus on HTML 5 tags 
			- Reason 
				- Browsers understand earlier versions anyways 
				- HTML5 is simplified 
				- HTML5, has better error handling 
				- HTML5 has multi media elements 
					- Means, browsers that support HTML 5 are also media players  
					Eg: Video & Audio 

  The purpose of learning HTML 
  **************************** 

    - The main purpose of learning HTML is to know how to properly tag your text documents in a way that the browser understands what you are trying to accomplish. 

      - Eg: If you are trying to include a title in the text document, how do you say it is a title. Or, if you want to include a paragraph, how do you say it is a paragraph and so on. 

    - To do this, you just follow the standard that browsers can understand 
    (HTML5 tags)

HTML Tags
********* 

	Basic rules of Tags 
	******************* 

		- Tags provide web browsers with instructions about the type of the texts included in the html document  

			Eg: 
				<h1> to mean a header </h1> 
				<h2> to mean a header 
				<h3> to mean a header 
				<h4> to mean a header 
				<h5> to mean a header </h5> 
				<h6> to mean a header 
				<p> to mean a paragraph <p/>

		1: Tags are always enclosed in angle brackets: < >  
			
			Eg: Paragraph tag  
				<p>


		2: Tags usually come in pairs: An opening tag and a closing tag 

			Eg: Paragraph tag

				<p>
					Content of the paragraph goes in between the opening and the closing tag.
				</p>

				<p>
					Opening paragraph tag indicates where the paragraph starts and the closing tag shows where it ends 
				</p>

		3: A few tags are called non-container tags. Means, they don't contain any content with in 
			
			Eg: Break tag 				

        <br> 

				<hr>
					
				<img>

		4: Tags are comprised of elements and attributes	

			Eg: Image tag with attribute width 

				<img src="../apple.png" width="500px" height="400px" alt="Apple's logo">

				<a href="https://www.apple.com/"> Apple Website </a>

				- The image tag (<img>) is the element and width and src in it are the attributes of the element. 

				- Notice that attributes are not included in between the opening and closing tags. They are rather included with in the opening tag itself 

  Basic HTML Tags
  *************** 
    The basic skeleton of every web page looks like this

      <html>

        <head>
          <title> </title>
          
        </head>

        <body>
        </body>

      </html>

    - The first tag in any HTML file is the <html> tag.
      - This tells web browsers that the document is an HTML file.

    - The second tag is a <head> tag. 
      - Information between the <head> tags doesn't appear in the browser window, but is still important.
      - It is called meta information.
      - The most important meta information in the HEAD tag is the <title> tag. 
        - Generally, the title should reflect the contents of the page 

    - The true content of your web page is included inside the <body> tag
