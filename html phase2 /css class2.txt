Understanding CSS
***************** 

	What is CSS? - Cascading Style Sheets  
	************************************* 

		- CSS is a set of instructions telling the browser what to do with the HTML elements. 
			Eg: 
				- What the color of an element should be 
				- Where exactly an element should be placed on the browser  
				- How wide or tall an element should be 
				- As the name indicates, the styling in general  

		- Note: CSS is useless without the HTML elements to apply the instructions on 

	CSS Versions 
	************
		
		- CSS3 is the latest version of CSS 
		
		- CSS3 is developed on top of the main principles of the previous versions. It just made things simpler and added a couple of additional features. 
		
		- Just focus on CSS3 as everything from the previous versions is included in it
		
		- Just so you know a little bit more about the differences, refer to this link 
			- https://hackr.io/blog/difference-between-css-css2-and-css3  


	Sending styling instructions to the browser 
	******************************************* 

	Your job is to make the browser understand what you are trying to accomplish 
		- Your browser is the builder. You are only allowed to send instructions on how it should build it (Technical term: Render it)

		- If you follow the standard way of telling the browser what to do with your HTML elements, it translates it the right way and renders it in the way you want  

		- You use the combination of HTML and CSS to accomplish that 

		- It is like sending a written instruction to someone who is suppose to reorder your house in a way you want it 
				(No pictures or videos allowed. Just written instruction)

			- Let's say the person reordering your house only speaks English. You don't have to know or use every single English word to effectively communicate with this person. 
					- You just have to use the words you know effectively.  

		- In this case, you are directly communicating with the browser. Same concept.  

	Adding CSS instructions on HTML 
	******************************* 
		
		- There are multiple ways of adding CSS instructions on our HTML 

		- Adding CSS instructions on the HTML file (On file)
			
			- We use the <style> tag to add CSS instructions directly on the HTML
			- This is usually done inside the <head> tag 

			- Eg: 
				- Add an on file style that changes the background of the body tag to red  

		- Inline
			
			- The main difference between the Inline styling and on file styling is that:
				- Inline styling is directly applied inside the opening tag of the html element 

			- We use the "style" property for that

			- Eg: 
				- Add an inline style on the <body> tag to change the background color to blue 


		- External CSS file 
			
			- This is the recommended way of including your CSS instructions on your HTML file 

			- The main concept is to create a separate css file containing all of the CSS instructions and link back (include) this css file on the html file. 

			- We use the <link> tag for that 

			- This is usually done inside the <head> tag

			- Eg: 
				- Add an external css file to change the background color to purple  

Key CSS concepts to understand 
****************************** 

	CSS units
	********* 

		- Having a clear understanding of the measuring units is the bases for any design and styling job 

		- There are a couple of commonly used measurement Units on CSS 

		- The most common one is the pixel (px). It is the size of 1/96th of an inch (0.26mm)

		- You have to train your brain to think in terms of pixels from now on  

		- Other commonly used units 
			- % 
				- This is when you want to describe your element in relation with other elements. Usually the containing elements 

			- em and rem
				- These are usually to define font sizes 
				- We use em to define font sizes in relation to the containing elements font size 
				- We use rem to define font sizes in relation to the base font size 
			
		- For further reading about CSS units, refer to this link 
			https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp

			- Eg: 
				- Add some width and height to a div 

		

	Thinking in terms of containers:  
	Organization comes before styling 
	*********************************  
		
		- This concept of wrapping elements in containers is the key in mastering CSS

		- Note that the wrappers or containers are HTML elements. The styling is mostly applied on them.  

		- Commonly used HTML containers 
			
			<header>
			<section>
				<div>
			<footer>
			
		- Before you even start writing a single CSS instruction, make sure to focus on organizing your HTML elements. 
			- Organizing your HTML means, Bundle related elements together with in a container. 
			- Try to think of the best way to group your elements together 

		- To help you understand what we mean by "Thinking in terms of containers" lets work on a small project called "The Puppies Page" together 
			- First thing first, every web page development starts with a design 
				- Designers are responsible to provide that to you 
					- Take a look at the Puppies page design 
						- puppies-page-design.jpg 

			- It is based on the design that you start to think about the structure of your HTML 
				- Take a look at the conceptual containers you should think of before building your HTML 

					- Only the containers 
						- only-containers.jpg 
					- Containers with content 
						- containers-with-content.jpg 
			
			- Then you build your HTML matching the containers you imagined 
				- Demo HTML 

	Naming containers and elements 
	*******************************

		- Naming is applied on the HTML elements 

		- Name every container in a way that is uniquely identifiable 

		- It is these names we later use to specifically identify the element we want to style 

			- We use classes & ids for naming elements  
				- Classes over ids are just names given to a specific HTML element 
				- You can give any name you think is appropriate 

			- Classes 
				- Are like family names
				- Can be used multiple times 
				- We use the "class" property to give a class name to an HTML element

				Eg: 
					- class="puppy-container"

			- IDs 
				- Are like unique names 
				- You shouldn't have similar ID names in a single page 
				- We use the "id" property to give an id to an HTML Element 

				Eg: 
					- id="banner-image"

	Selecting specific elements
	*************************** 

		- Like we have said earlier, CSS is just a set of instructions the browser should follow to render the HTML elements 

		- To write CSS instructions for an HTML element, we need to first correctly identify the element. This is what selecting means 

		- There are multiple ways of selecting a specific HTML element 

			-  Here is a useful link listing out the 30 most used CSS selectors 
			https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048 

			- We are going to focus on some of them in here 

			Class selector 
			************** 

				- This is a way of selecting an HTML element using their class name 

				- We use the dot (.) identifier for that 

				Eg: 
					.className { /* a . followed by the class name of the HTML element */
						/* Instruction goes in here */
						/* In between the curly braces */
					}

					.bold-title {
						color: red;
						font-weight: bold; 
					}


			ID selector 
			************** 

				- This is a way of selecting an HTML element using their ID 

				- We use the dot (#) identifier for that 

				Eg: 
					#id { /* a # sign followed by the ID of the HTML element */
						/* Instruction goes in here */
						/* In between the curly braces */
					}

					#header-wrapper{
						background-color: black; 
					}

			Type Selector 
			*************
				- This is a way of selecting an HTML element based on their type 
				
				- This is useful when we want a specific HTML element type to behave on a certain way  

				Eg: 
					- If we want all the links on our website to be of color red 

					a {
						color: red; 
					}


			The star  
			******** 

				- This is when we want to apply a certain instruction on every single HTML element 

				Eg: 

					- If we dont want any of the HTML elements to have a margin 
						- Margin is just the space out side of an elements boarder 

					* {
						margin: 0; 
					}


			Descendant Selector 
			*******************

				- Sometimes, just using the class name or the element type might not provide a specific enough selection as we want to 

				- We use descendant selector style for that 

				- You can assume this as using the full name of a person 
					- Sometimes, some people have the same first name. We need to add their last name to be specific

					- The Parent & Child concept 
						- The outer wrapper of an HTML tag is called the parent 
						- The one in the inside is the child 

				Eg: 
					- Make every link on the website to be of color red, exept when the link is inside the header. If in header, make it white  

					a {
						color: red; 
					}

					#header-wrapper a { 
						color: white;
					}
					/* Note that css uses the parent name first style */


			Hover Selector  
			************** 
				- This is more of an action selector 

				- Gets activated when you hover your cursor on an HTML element

				- For example, when we hover over an anchor link. 
					- You can add CSS instructions when a specific action is taken on an HTML element.
					- Say for example, change the color of the link to green and underline it, when people hover over it  

				Ex: 
					a:hover {
						color: green;
						text-decoration: underline;
					}
