Creating HTML pages 
******************* 

  NOTE (Recommended approach): 
  ****************************

    Pay Attention!!
    ***************  
      - A single spelling error can make your html page not to work. This usually takes a lot of your time to fix and be the cause of frustration

      Solution:
        - Being organized helps you a lot  
          - All of your documents need to be organized in their own folder 

        - Formatting is your best friend 
          - Install Prettier 

        - Every time you write a single line make sure everything is working and formatted correctly before you start the next line of code. 

        - Being able to find these simple errors on your own is what the training is. NOT just knowing what the tags are 
        
        - Make sure you are in your best mental state when you are working on this 
          - It is better to take a break and come back to it as this demands sharp focus

    DON'T RUSH!! 
    ************ 
      - If there is a single thing you don't understand, do NOT move to the next line before you clearly understand it 

      - One way to double check if you understand it is to ask yourself WHY you do the part you are doing. 
      Now HOW to do it but WHY. If you can't answer the WHY that means you don't understand it. 

      - Take your time as much as you can 

  Steps to create an HTML page (.html)   
  ************************************ 

    Step 1: Always create a folder for every project you work on 

      - To do this, go to your favorite working location and create a folder
      - Give the folder a proper name that relates with your project 

    Step 2: Open the folder using your editor (VS) 

    Step 3: Create an HTML document 

      - An HTML document is a simple text file with a .html extension 
      - Save that file with in your working folder 

    Step 4: Define the DOCTYPE  

      - The first line of any HTML document starts by defining the HTML doctype 
      
      - Since we are writing the HTML5 standard, the way to define the doctype is just including the following line at the top of the document 

        <!DOCTYPE html> 

    Step 5: Include the initial HTML boiler tags 

      - These boiler tags are the ones which are part of every HTML document 
      - It includes the <html>, <head> and <body> tags. 
      - Make sure all of them are closed properly 
        - Tip: Visual Studio can help you create these quickly 

    Step 6: Give title for your document 
      
      - This is defined with in the <title> tag under the <head> section 
      - At this point, you would have a starter HTML document ready 

    Step 7: Start including the contents to your document 

      - The main content of your HTML document is included with in the <body> tag 

      - Always start by including an <h1> tag 
        - <h1> is the main header tag used as the main title of your document 
        - This header is different form the title you already included inside the <title> tag 
        - An HTML document is suppose to have only a single <h1> tag. If you want to include more headings, use the <h2> - <h6> 

      - All the other tags you use are dependent on the type of content you want to include
